Let's setup codespace for the URL, start the server via VS Code launch.json, and test the API.

- All Django project files are in the `octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker` directory.
- Only update urls in `settings.py` and `urls.py`
- REST api endpoint format https://$CODESPACE_NAME-8000.app.github.dev/api/[component]/
- example full url: https://$CODESPACE_NAME-8000.app.github.dev/api/activities/
- Do not hard code the `$CODESPACE_NAME` value use the variable
- Do not update the `views.py`

1. Update `urls.py` to replace the return for the REST API URL endpoints with the environment variable $CODESPACE_NAME https://$CODESPACE_NAME-8000.app.github.dev for Django and avoid certificate HTTPS issues.
2. Make sure the Django backend works on your codespace URL and localhost (i.e., )

====
Let's setup the octofit-tracker frontend React  framework and
ensure everything is created in the `octofit-tracker/frontend` directory by using `--prefix`

1. Make sure the the octofit-tracker/frontend directory exists.
2. create the react app
3. Install react, bootstrap, and react-router-dom
4. Import bootstrap css in the src/index.js file.
5. Don't change .gitignore file

====
Let's update the octofit-tracker frontend React components.
- Update the following components to include the React framework to point to the backend REST API:
- src/App.js
- src/index.js
- src/components/Activities.js
- src/components/Leaderboard.js
- src/components/Teams.js
- src/components/Users.js
- src/components/Workouts.js
- In each component replace the fetch url with the codespace url
https://$REACT_APP_CODESPACE_NAME-8000.app.github.dev/api/[component]/
for the Django rest framework backend.
make sure all components are pulling data from the REST api endpoint
for display in the REACT frontend
- Make sure to use the correct port and protocol http or https.
- Update src/App.js to include the main navigation for all components.
- Make sure react-router-dom is used for the navigation menu.
- The react app should show the navigation menu and the components.
- Update all components to log the fetched data and make them compatible with both paginated (.results) and plain array responses.
- Add console.log statements to each component to log the fetched data and the REST API endpoints.




====
Let's style this like App.css and make it look nice.
- Let's make the App.js and all components javascript files in the app are consistent with the following:
- Use bootstrap tables for the data in all javascript components.
- Use bootstrap buttons for the buttons.
- Use bootstrap headings for the headings.
- Use bootstrap links for the links.
- Use bootstrap navigation for the navigation menu.
- Use bootstrap forms for the forms.
- Use bootstrap cards for the cards.
- Use bootstrap modals for the modals.
- Consistent table layouts for all components data.
